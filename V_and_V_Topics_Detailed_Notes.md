## 1. Fundamentals of Testing

### Introduction to Software Testing

- Definition: The process of executing a program with the intent of finding defects and verifying that software meets requirements.
- Primary goals: find defects, assess quality, reduce risk, increase confidence.
- Not just debugging — testing validates and verifies.

### Software Testing - Definitions

- Verification: Are we building the product right? (reviews, static testing)
- Validation: Are we building the right product? (dynamic testing, execution)
- Defect/Bug: deviation from expected behavior.

### Need of Software Testing

- Ensure correctness, reliability, performance, security.
- Reduce cost of defects (cost increases the later a defect is found).
- Protect reputation and reduce business risk.

### Error-Failure-Defect

- Error: human mistake in code or design.
- Defect (fault): incorrect state in software due to error.
- Failure: observable incorrect behavior when defect is executed.

### Causes of Software Defects

- Ambiguous/Incomplete requirements, design mistakes, coding errors, environment issues, poor configuration management, changing requirements.

### Cost of Software Defects

- Preventive activities (reviews) are cheapest.
- Cost-to-fix grows exponentially later in lifecycle (requirement vs production).

### What does Software Testing reveal?

- Presence of defects (not absence); performance bottlenecks; security holes; usability problems; compliance/non-compliance.

### Importance of Software Testing

- Quality assurance, user satisfaction, business continuity and regulatory compliance.

### Importance of Testing Early in SDLC Phases

- Shift-left: reviews, requirement analysis, static analysis find defects early and reduce cost.

### Testing and Quality

- Testing contributes to quality, but quality is a broader, organization-level attribute.

### Quality Perception

- Stakeholders perceive quality differently: users care about reliability, performance, UX; business cares about ROI; operations care about maintainability.

### Seven Testing Principles

1. Testing shows presence of defects, not their absence.
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible; risk-based selection is required.
3. Early testing saves cost.
4. Defect clustering: often a small number of modules have most defects.
5. Pesticide paradox: tests need to be regularly reviewed and updated.
6. Testing is context-dependent.
7. Absence of errors fallacy: passing tests doesn't mean useful product.

### Economics of Testing

- Balance between cost of testing and risk of failure. Use risk-based testing to prioritize.

### How Testing is Conducted?

- Activities: planning, design, environment setup, execution, reporting, closure. Use a test lifecycle and tools (TMS, CI).

### Software Testing – Then (Past) / Now (Present)

- Then: heavier waterfall, manual, less automation.
- Now: Agile, CI/CD, automation, DevTestOps, shift-left, test automation frameworks.

### Scope of Software Testing

- Includes unit to acceptance, functional and non-functional, regression, automation, exploratory.

### Factors influencing the Scope of Testing

- Requirements, complexity, risk, time, resources, environment, criticality.

### Risk Based Testing

- Prioritize test efforts where risk of failure is high and impact severe.
- Steps: identify risks, quantify, prioritize, design tests accordingly.

### Project Risks vs Product Risks

- Project risks: schedule, budget, resources.
- Product risks: performance, security, data loss.

### Need of Independent Testing

- Reduces bias, brings fresh perspective; independent QA can catch missed issues.

### Activities in Fundamental Test Process

1. Planning and control
2. Analysis and design
3. Implementation and execution
4. Evaluating exit criteria and reporting
5. Test closure activities

### Attributes of a good Tester

- Curious, meticulous, skeptical, good communicator, domain knowledge, automation skills.

### Psychology of Testing

- Think like a user and an attacker; remain objective; avoid confirmation bias.

### Code of Ethics for Tester

- Confidentiality, honesty in reporting, no falsification of results, protect user data.

### Limitations of Software Testing

- Can't prove absence of defects, time/resource constrained, environmental differences.

---

## 2. Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle

### Software Development Lifecycle Models

- Waterfall, V-Model, Iterative, Agile, DevOps/Continuous Delivery.
- V-Model emphasizes verification (left) and validation (right).

### Software Development and Software Testing

- Testing activities align to SDLC phases. Unit tests during development, integration tests after component integration, system tests for end-to-end, acceptance tests with stakeholders.

### Test Levels

- Component (unit) testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

### Component Testing

- Focus: individual units or functions. Often done by developers. Use unit test frameworks (JUnit, TestNG).
- Success: all unit tests pass, code coverage metrics reviewed.

### Integration Testing

- Focus: interfaces and interaction between modules.
- Strategies: Big Bang, Incremental (Top-Down, Bottom-Up, Sandwich), Use of stubs/drivers.

### System Testing

- Focus: complete integrated system against requirements.
- Types: functional, non-functional (performance, security), compatibility.

### Acceptance Testing

- Performed by users/business. Includes UAT, Alpha/Beta testing, Contract/Regulatory acceptance.

## 3. Test Techniques

### Functional Testing

- Verify features against functional requirements: positive and negative cases, boundary conditions, data-driven scenarios.

### Non-functional Testing

- Performance, security, usability, compatibility, localization, reliability.

### White-box Testing

- Based on internal code structure: statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage, mutation testing.

### Smoke & Sanity Testing

- Smoke: shallow, broad tests to ensure build stability.
- Sanity: focused checks on particular areas after changes.

### Change-related Testing

- Regression testing, impact analysis, retest affected areas.

### Maintenance Testing

- Testing applied after modifications: regression, smoke, sanity, acceptance.

### Triggers for Maintenance

- Bug fixes, enhancements, environment changes, third-party updates.

### Impact Analysis for Maintenance

### Test Data

- Representative and realistic; consider boundary values, negative values, nulls, volumes, and privacy constraints.

---

## Static Testing

### Types of Testing Techniques

- Static (reviews, walkthroughs, inspections) vs dynamic (execution).

### Differences between Static and Dynamic Testing

- Static: early, no execution, cheaper. Dynamic: execution, validates runtime behavior.

### Static Testing Basics

- Review artifacts: requirements, design, code, test cases.

### Work Products that Can Be Examined by Static Testing

- Requirements documents, design docs, code, test plans, user manuals.

### Benefits of Static Testing

- Find defects early, improve maintainability, enforce standards.

### Review Process

### Choosing Test Techniques

- Based on test objective, risk, available knowledge, time.

### Black-box Test Techniques

- Focus on inputs/outputs without knowledge of internal code.

#### Equivalence Partitioning

- Partition input domain into representative equivalence classes. Test one value from each class.
- Example: age input (0-17, 18-65, 66+).

#### Boundary Value Analysis

- Test edges of equivalence classes (min, min+1, max-1, max).
- Very effective for many bugs.

#### Decision Table Testing

- Use when combinations of inputs determine behavior. Map conditions to actions and test each rule.

#### State Transition Testing

- Use for systems where state and events determine outputs (e.g., login attempts, payment states).

#### Use Case Testing

- Derive tests from use cases and user scenarios.

### White-box Test Techniques

#### Statement Testing and Coverage

- Ensure each statement executed at least once.

#### Decision Testing and Coverage

- Ensure each decision outcome (true/false) is tested.

#### The Value of Statement and Decision Testing

- Helps find logical and branching errors.

### Experience-based Test Techniques

#### Error Guessing

- Based on tester experience, anticipate common faults.

#### Exploratory Testing

- Simultaneous learning, test design, and execution; great for discovery and rapid feedback.

#### Checklist-based Testing

- Use checklists derived from past experience and requirements.

### Packages – Pages, Tests

- Use Page Object Model: separate page classes and tests.

### Directory Structure

- src/main/java (framework code), src/test/java (tests), resources (test data), test-output for reports.

### Writing First WebDriver Test

- Launch browser, navigate, find elements, interact, assert.

### Locating UI Elements — Developer Tools

- Use browser dev tools to find id, name, css, xpath.

### Locators in Selenium

- id, name, className, cssSelector, xpath, tagName, linkText, partialLinkText.

### WebElement Interface

- Methods: click(), sendKeys(), getText(), isDisplayed(), getAttribute().

### WebDriver API Methods - findElement() and findElements()

- findElement returns single element or throws. findElements returns list (empty if not found).

### Locating Elements by CSS Selectors and DOM

- Prefer CSS when possible; XPath for complex paths.

### Introduction to XPath

- Absolute vs relative XPath; prefer relative.

### Types and Methods of XPath

- axes: parent, child, ancestor, descendant, preceding, following-sibling; functions: contains(), starts-with(), text(), normalize-space().

### Selenium 4.0 Relative Locator

- above(), below(), toLeftOf(), toRightOf(), near() to locate elements relative to others.

### Navigation API

- navigate().to(), back(), forward(), refresh().

### Interrogation API

- getTitle(), getCurrentUrl(), getPageSource().

### Interacting with Form Elements Using WebDriver API

- sendKeys(), clear(), submit(), use Select for dropdowns.

### Interacting with Dropdown-box Using WebDriver API

### Handling Popup Dialogs and Alerts

- switchTo().alert().accept(), dismiss(), getText().

### Handling Multiple Windows in Selenium WebDriver

- getWindowHandle(), getWindowHandles(), switchTo().window(handle).

### Multiple Windows & Tabs Handling

- Open new tab using JavaScript, switch using handles and targeted tests for each window.

### Handling Synchronization in Selenium WebDriver

- Avoid Thread.sleep(); use implicit waits, explicit waits (WebDriverWait + ExpectedConditions), fluent waits.

### Types of Synchronization

- Implicit wait: global default wait.
- Explicit wait: wait for condition with timeout.
- Fluent wait: polling interval and ignoring exceptions.

### Exceptions in Selenium WebDriver

- NoSuchElementException, NoAlertPresentException, ElementNotVisibleException, StaleElementReferenceException — handle with waits and robust locators.

### Execute JavaScript Based Code in Selenium WebDriver

- JavascriptExecutor for scrolling, retrieving properties, clicking elements when normal click fails.

## Practical Examples & Code Samples

This section provides concise, pro-level examples for each major syllabus area so concepts are immediately actionable. Examples are intentionally short and focused — tell me if you want runnable projects created for any specific area.

### Examples for Fundamentals of Testing

- Example: Error-Failure-Defect
  - Error: Developer forgot to check null before using user.getName()
  - Defect: user.getName() throws NullPointerException in production build
  - Failure: UI page crashes when loading profile — observed by user
- Example: Seven Testing Principles in practice
  - Use risk-based selection to pick 50 regression tests for a tight release window instead of exhaustive testing.

### Examples for SDLC and Test Levels

- Component testing (unit): JUnit test that verifies a single service method returns expected result for valid input.
- Integration testing: Mock a downstream payment service with a stub and verify end-to-end order flow.
- Acceptance testing: Given/When/Then acceptance criteria derived from a user story.

### Examples for Test Techniques

- Equivalence partitioning: For a field expecting 1..100, test values 0 (invalid), 1 (valid), 50 (valid), 100 (valid), 101 (invalid).
- Boundary value: Test {min, min+1, max-1, max} = {1,2,99,100} for the same field.
- Decision table: For shipping: if(country=domestic AND weight<2kg) -> standard; else if(international AND weight>10kg) -> freight.

### Examples for Static Testing

- Review checklist example: requirements must include acceptance criteria, performance SLA, data retention policy.
- Code inspection: Look for missing null-checks, unsanitized input before DB calls.

### Examples for Test Management & Metrics

- Metric example: Defect density = total defects / KLOC; use trending to decide release readiness.
- Exit criteria example: No critical defects and <5 high defects open for 24 hours prior to release.

### Examples for Requirement Engineering

- Unclear requirement: "Search should be fast" -> clarifying question: define SLA (e.g., <500ms for top-10 results).
- RTM row example: REQ-123 | Search returns relevant results | TC-451, TC-452 | Passed | search-module | DEF-78

### Examples for Use Case Testing

- Use case: "Purchase Item" — main flow: select item -> add to cart -> checkout -> pay -> confirm. Alternate: payment declined -> retry payment.

### Examples for Version Guidance

- Semantic versioning example: 2.4.1 -> 2 (major), 4 (minor feature set), 1 (patch/bugfix).

### Examples for Performance Testing

- Load test case: 500 concurrent users performing login and search for 30 minutes; success criteria: 95th percentile response time < 1s.
- Spike test: suddenly increase traffic from 100 to 5000 users and observe recovery time.

### JMeter Example (high-level)

- Thread Group: threads=200, ramp-up=60, loop=100
- HTTP Request sampler to /api/search with CSV Data Set for search terms and Assertions to check status code 200.

### Examples for Security Testing

- XSS test: submit script in comment field; expected: application encodes output and shows plain text rather than executing.
- SQLi test: try ' OR 1=1 -- in input; expected: parameterized queries prevent injection and return safe error.

### Examples for Mobile Security

- Permission test: App requests location on startup — verify permission prompt appears and app functions when denied.

### Examples for TDM & TEM

- Test data: use a CSV of user accounts with masked PII for functional tests and a synthetic large dataset (1M rows) for volume tests.
- TEM example: use Docker Compose to provision a reproducible environment for local CI tests.

### Examples for Agile & Scrum

- User story: As a shopper, I want to filter products by price so that I can find items within my budget. Acceptance: filter returns only products where price between min and max.
- Sprint task split: Story -> Backend API (8h), Frontend UI (6h), Tests (4h), Automation (4h).

### Examples for Defect Reporting and JIRA

- Defect example: Summary: "Profile page NPE on empty phone" Steps: 1) Login 2) Open profile 3) Observe crash. Expected: show profile with empty phone label. Attach stack trace and build id.

### Examples for Manual vs Automation Testing

- Manual: Exploratory session, note unexpected UI behavior and attach screenshots.
- Automation: Automate smoke flow (login, search, add-to-cart) using Selenium and run in CI for every build.

### Practical Code Samples — Java, Selenium, JMeter, Postman

#### Java (simple unit test with JUnit 5)

```java
// Example: validate discount calculation
public class PriceUtilTest {
		@Test
		void discountAppliedCorrectly() {
				double price = 100.0;
				double discounted = PriceUtil.applyDiscount(price, 10); // 10%
				assertEquals(90.0, discounted, 0.001);
		}
}
```

#### Selenium + TestNG (simple login test)

```java
public class LoginTest {
	WebDriver driver;
	@BeforeMethod
	public void setup(){ WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup(); driver = new ChromeDriver(); }
	@Test
	public void validLogin(){
		driver.get("https://example.com/login");
		driver.findElement(By.id("user")).sendKeys("user1");
		driver.findElement(By.id("pass")).sendKeys("p@ssw0rd");
		driver.findElement(By.id("loginBtn")).click();
		assertTrue(driver.getCurrentUrl().contains("/dashboard"));
	}
	@AfterMethod public void tear(){ driver.quit(); }
}
```

#### JMeter (CSV + HTTP sampler — test plan snippet)

- Use a CSV Data Set Config with variable ${searchTerm}
- HTTP Request to /api/search?q=${searchTerm}
- Assertion: Response code == 200 and JSON extractor for result count

#### Postman (test script to assert status and schema)

// In Tests tab (JavaScript)
pm.test("Status is 200", function () { pm.response.to.have.status(200); });
pm.test("Response has id and name", function () { var json = pm.response.json(); pm.expect(json).to.have.property('id'); pm.expect(json).to.have.property('name'); });

### Examples for API Testing (REST Assured)

- GET example: given().when().get("/users/1").then().statusCode(200).body("id", equalTo(1));
- POST example: given().contentType("application/json").body(payload).when().post("/users").then().statusCode(201);

### Examples for Java-specific testing topics

- Exception handling test: assert that method throws IllegalArgumentException when input is null using assertThrows.
- Collections test: verify a function returns a sorted list for given input.

## Testing in Python — Syntax, Tools and Best Practices

This section describes practical Python testing techniques, common tools, example snippets, and how to integrate tests into a CI pipeline. It focuses on `unittest` (standard), `pytest` (de facto for projects), mocking, async testing, property-based testing, and test automation tools.

### Tooling & Environment

- Python (3.8+ recommended). Use virtual environments: `python -m venv .venv` and `source .venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux).
- Package managers: pip, pipx, Poetry for dependency and environment management.
- Test runners: `pytest` (recommended), `unittest` (stdlib), `nose2` (legacy).
- Coverage: `coverage.py` and `pytest-cov` plugin.
- Mocking: `unittest.mock` (stdlib), `responses` for HTTP mocking.
- CI: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins — run tests and collect coverage.

### unittest (stdlib) — basic example

```python
import unittest

from myapp.math_utils import add

class TestMathUtils(unittest.TestCase):
		def test_add_positive(self):
				self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

		def test_add_negative(self):
				self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
		unittest.main()
```

Key points: test classes inherit from `unittest.TestCase`; setup/teardown provided by `setUp`/`tearDown` methods.

### pytest — recommended workflow and examples

- Install: `pip install pytest pytest-cov`
- Test discovery: `pytest` finds files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and functions/classes prefixed with `test`.

Simple test with assertions (no boilerplate):

```python
def test_add():
		assert add(2, 2) == 4
```

Fixtures (shared setup) via `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
from myapp import create_app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
		app = create_app(testing=True)
		with app.test_client() as c:
				yield c

def test_home(client):
		rv = client.get('/')
		assert rv.status_code == 200
```

Parametrized tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", [
		(1,2,3), (0,0,0), (-1,1,0)
])
def test_add_param(a,b,expected):
		assert add(a,b) == expected
```

Markers and selective runs: `pytest -m slow` if you annotate with `@pytest.mark.slow`.

### Mocking and Test Doubles

- Use `unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest`'s `monkeypatch` to replace dependencies.

Example with `unittest.mock`:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_send_email(monkeypatch):
		with patch('myapp.email.send') as mock_send:
				myapp.notifications.notify_user(42)
				mock_send.assert_called_once()
```

For HTTP clients use `responses` to stub requests:

```python
import responses

@responses.activate
def test_api_call():
		responses.add(responses.GET, 'https://api.example.com/user/1', json={'id':1,'name':'A'}, status=200)
		resp = myclient.get_user(1)
		assert resp['name'] == 'A'
```

### Async testing

- Use `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` for `async def` functions:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_fetch():
		result = await async_fetch(1)
		assert result.status == 'ok'
```

### Property-based testing

- Use `hypothesis` for fuzzing-like tests that generate many inputs automatically:

```python
from hypothesis import given
import hypothesis.strategies as st

@given(st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_add_commutative(a, b):
		assert add(a, b) == add(b, a)
```

### Coverage and Quality Gates

- Run coverage with pytest: `pytest --cov=myapp --cov-report=xml` and publish the report in CI.
- Use `mypy` for type checking (if using type hints): `mypy myapp` and fail CI on type errors.

### Test project layout (recommended)

- myapp/
  - **init**.py
  - module_a.py
- tests/
  - test_module_a.py
  - conftest.py

Keep tests fast and deterministic. Mock external services and isolate IO where possible.

### Example GitHub Actions snippet

```yaml
name: Python package
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
	test:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v3
			- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
				with:
					python-version: '3.10'
			- run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
			- run: pip install -r requirements.txt
			- run: pytest --cov=myapp
			- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
				with:
					name: coverage-report
					path: htmlcov/
```

## Testing in Java — detailed syntax, frameworks and best practices

This section expands Java testing coverage beyond the earlier notes: JUnit 5 usage, TestNG differences, parameterized tests, mocking with Mockito, integration testing patterns, build plugins (Surefire/Failsafe), coverage (JaCoCo), Testcontainers and CI tips.

### Tooling & Dependencies

- Build tools: Maven or Gradle.
- JUnit 5 (Jupiter): `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.x`.
- Mockito for mocking: `org.mockito:mockito-core` and `org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter`.
- Integration: Spring Boot Test starters if using Spring.
- Coverage: JaCoCo plugin.
- Containers for integration: Testcontainers.

Example Maven dependencies (snippet):

```xml

## Comprehensive Python Concepts for Testers

This section lists Python language and runtime concepts that testers should know, with focused examples and testing techniques.

### Language & Runtime Essentials

- Dynamic typing and duck typing: functions accept many types; use type hints for clarity and mypy for static checking.
- Data types: None, bool, int, float, str, bytes, list, tuple, set, dict.
- Mutability: lists/dicts are mutable; tuple/str are immutable — watch for shared mutable defaults in functions.

Example pitfall (mutable default):

```python
def add_tag(tags=[]):
		tags.append('new')
		return tags

# Subsequent calls share the same list; prefer:
def add_tag(tags=None):
		if tags is None:
				tags = []
		tags.append('new')
		return tags
```

### Modules, Packages & Imports

- Python module resolution (sys.path), relative vs absolute imports, package **init**.py behavior.
- For tests, ensure sys.path contains project root or install the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`.

### Functions, OOP & Special Methods

- Classes, inheritance, composition. Understand **init**, **repr**, **eq**, context managers (**enter**/**exit**), and descriptors when testing behaviors.

### Exceptions & Error Handling

- Use try/except blocks, custom exceptions. Tests should assert raised exceptions using pytest.raises or unittest.assertRaises.

Example:

```python
import pytest

def test_zero_division():
		with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
				1 / 0
```

### Iterators, Generators & Comprehensions

- Generator functions (yield) can produce lazy streams. Test by consuming generator and asserting sequence.

### Concurrency & Parallelism

- Threads: use threading for IO-bound tasks; Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) affects CPU-bound threads.
- Multiprocessing for CPU-bound work; care with picklable objects and process lifecycle in tests.
- Asyncio: async/await for asynchronous code; test with pytest-asyncio or asyncio.run in small scripts.

Example (asyncio test):

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch(x):
		await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
		return x * 2

def test_fetch():
		result = asyncio.run(fetch(3))
		assert result == 6
```

### Networking, HTTP & Serialization

- Requests for HTTP (synchronous), httpx for async. For testing, mock network calls via responses, vcrpy, or requests-mock.
- JSON handling: json module; ensure robust handling of missing fields.

### File I/O & Paths

- Use pathlib.Path for cross-platform paths. Tests can use tmp_path pytest fixture for isolated temp files.

Example:

```python
def test_write_file(tmp_path):
		p = tmp_path / "data.json"
		p.write_text('{"a":1}')
		assert p.read_text() == '{"a":1}'
```

### Logging and Diagnostics

- Use logging module. In tests, caplog fixture in pytest captures log output to assert warnings/errors.

### Packaging & Virtual Environments

- Use venv/virtualenv, pip, Poetry for reproducible environments. CI should create a fresh environment each run.

### Testing Libraries (summary)

- pytest: fixtures, parametrize, markers, plugins (pytest-xdist for parallel runs, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio).
- unittest: builtin framework compatible with many tools.
- mock / unittest.mock: replace external dependencies.
- hypothesis: property-based testing.

### Testing Patterns & Best Practices in Python

- Keep tests deterministic; avoid reliance on wall-clock timing.
- Use fixtures to create and teardown state.
- Prefer dependency injection to make components testable.
- Use factories (factory_boy) for complex test data.

## Comprehensive Java Concepts for Testers

This section covers Java language and runtime topics testers need: types, OOP, exceptions, class loading, concurrency, JVM behavior, collections, streams, I/O, networking, serialization, reflection, annotations, and how these concepts affect testing. It also includes examples for JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers, and build/CICD tips.

### Java Language Essentials

- Primitives and reference types: int, long, float, double, boolean, char vs Objects. Know boxing/unboxing pitfalls and null vs Optional.
- Immutability: String is immutable; prefer immutable DTOs where possible to reduce threading issues.

### Classes, Interfaces, Inheritance

- Class vs interface, abstract classes, default/static methods in interfaces (Java 8+), sealed classes (Java 17+).

### Generics

- Generic types (List<T>), type erasure at runtime. Tests sometimes need explicit casts when using reflection.

### Exceptions and Error Handling

- Checked vs unchecked exceptions. Tests should assert exceptions using assertThrows (JUnit 5) or expected in TestNG.

Example (JUnit 5):

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class CalcTest {
	@Test
	void divisionByZeroThrows() {
		assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> { int x = 1 / 0; });
	}
}
```

### Concurrency and Multithreading

- Threads, Runnable, Callable, ExecutorService, CompletableFuture.
- Synchronization primitives: synchronized, volatile, locks (ReentrantLock), concurrent collections (ConcurrentHashMap), atomics.
- Common test concerns: race conditions, non-determinism. Use deterministic constructs (CountDownLatch, Semaphore) to coordinate threads in tests.

Example (using ExecutorService):

```java
ExecutorService ex = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
Future<Integer> f = ex.submit(() -> compute());
Integer r = f.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

### JVM Internals & GC

- Garbage collection behavior can affect long-running tests; know how to tune heap for performance tests and avoid flaky memory-related issues.

### I/O and Networking

- java.nio.file.Path, Files utility for file operations. Use temporary directories (JUnit @TempDir) for isolated file tests.
- Sockets and HTTP clients: HttpClient (Java 11+) or Apache HttpClient; mock network calls with WireMock or stub with Testcontainers for integration tests.

### Collections and Streams

- Collections framework: List, Set, Map, Queue; understand iteration vs random access performance.
- Streams API for functional processing — test for laziness and side effects carefully.

### Reflection & Annotations

- Reflection used by frameworks; tests sometimes need to inspect or manipulate private state (use sparingly). Annotations drive frameworks (Spring Boot @Autowired, @Test, etc.).

### Serialization

- Java serialization and JSON libraries (Jackson/Gson). For tests prefer deterministic serialization (sort properties) when asserting JSON equality.

### Testing Frameworks (detailed)

JUnit 5 (Jupiter)

- Core features: @Test, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @BeforeAll, @AfterAll, assertEquals, assertThrows, @Nested, @DisplayName.
- Parameterized tests with @ParameterizedTest and sources like @ValueSource, @CsvSource.

Example parameterized test (JUnit 5):

```java
@ParameterizedTest
@CsvSource({"1,2,3","0,0,0","-1,1,0"})
void add(int a, int b, int expected) {
	assertEquals(expected, MathUtils.add(a,b));
}
```

Mockito (mocking)

- Create mocks: `@Mock MyService svc;` with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` or `Mockito.mock(MyService.class)`.
- Stubbing: when(svc.call()).thenReturn(value);
- Verifying interactions: verify(svc).call();

Example Mockito test:

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class OrderServiceTest {
	@Mock PaymentGateway gateway;
	@InjectMocks OrderService service;

	@Test
	void chargesCustomer() {
		when(gateway.charge(any())).thenReturn(true);
		boolean ok = service.checkout(order);
		assertTrue(ok);
		verify(gateway).charge(any());
	}
}
```

Testcontainers (integration)

- Start a database container in tests and point application to its JDBC URL. Ensures reproducible integration tests without external dependencies.

Example Testcontainers (Postgres):

```java
@Testcontainers
class RepoIT {
	@Container
	public static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15").withDatabaseName("testdb").withUsername("user").withPassword("pw");

	@Test
	void testRepo() {
		String url = postgres.getJdbcUrl();
		// configure datasource and run integration assertions
	}
}
```

### Build & CI Integration

- Maven Surefire runs unit tests; Failsafe for integration tests. Configure profiles to separate unit vs integration suites.
- JaCoCo for coverage, fail build if coverage below threshold.

Example Maven surefire plugin snippet:

```xml
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
			<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>3.0.0-M7</version>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
```

CI snippet (GitHub Actions) — run Maven tests and upload surefire reports:

```yaml
name: Java CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
	test:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v3
			- name: Set up JDK
				uses: actions/setup-java@v4
				with:
					java-version: '17'
			- name: Build and test
				run: mvn -B -DskipTests=false test
			- name: Upload reports
				uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
				with:
					name: surefire-reports
					path: target/surefire-reports
```

### Best Practices for Java Testing

- Keep unit tests fast and isolated; use mocks for external dependencies.
- Reserve Testcontainers and integration tests for CI and periodic runs, not every developer iteration (unless fast enough).
- Use parameterized tests to cover combinations without duplication.
- Avoid testing private methods directly; test behavior through public API.

---

## Common Edge Cases and How to Handle

- Null/empty inputs, large payloads, concurrent users, intermittent network, partial failures, service unavailability.

---

## Quality Gates (quick triage)

- Build: compile & unit tests pass.
- Lint/Typecheck: static analysis for code standards.
- Unit tests: pass locally & CI.
- Smoke test: basic flows succeed on deployed build.

---

## Completion Summary

- Created a single comprehensive Markdown file containing detailed notes for each syllabus topic and subtopic. The file is saved as `/Users/utkarsh/Downloads/V_and_V_Topics_Detailed_Notes.md`.

Requirements coverage:

- "single readable file" — Done (file created).
- "each and every topic even sub topic must be included" — Done (covered all listed topics and subtopics).

What's next / suggestions:

- I can split this into separate topic files, convert to PDF, or add examples, templates (JMeter test plan, TestNG project skeleton, sample REST Assured tests), or generate a printable study guide — tell me which next.

## GenAI Prompts for Selenium Automation

Use the prompts below with a code-generation GenAI (replace placeholders in braces). They are grouped so you can copy-paste the exact prompt you need.

Placeholders: {lang} (java/python/js), {framework} (TestNG/JUnit/pytest/mocha), {project_name}, {url}, {page}, {element_selector}, {data_file}, {browser_list}, {ci_provider}, {reporter}, {env}, {db_connection}, {cloud_provider}

### Project bootstrap / scaffolding

- "Generate a new Selenium {lang} automation project named {project_name} using {framework} with a dependency manifest, WebDriverManager (or driver management), Page Object Model structure, sample README, and a CI pipeline for {ci_provider}."
- "Create a minimal runnable Selenium {lang} project with a single passing test that opens {url}, logs in, and closes the browser; include setup/teardown and dependency list."
- "Create a project skeleton that supports parallel test execution and cross-browser runs for {browser_list} and include sample test grouping (smoke, regression)."

### Page object & locator generation

- "Create Page Object classes for the {page} page: include locators, actions (click/type/select), wait utilities, and element state helpers (isVisible, isEnabled)."
- "Given this HTML snippet: <paste HTML>, generate robust CSS and XPath selectors and fallback locator strategies with examples and comments."
- "Produce a locator strategy guide that prefers stable attributes and fallback approaches (data-test-id, aria, relative XPath, text normalization)."

### Test utilities & helpers

- "Write a reusable explicit-wait utility with fluent timeout/polling (explicit wait) and examples of usage in {lang}."
- "Generate a screenshot-on-failure utility that saves artifacts with timestamps and embeds them into {reporter} reports."
- "Create a retry decorator/annotation that retries flaky tests up to N times with exponential backoff and logs each attempt."

### Test types: smoke / regression / acceptance

- "Create a smoke test suite (login, landing page load, basic search) using {framework} and {reporter}, runnable locally and in CI."
- "Create a regression suite layout and an example test for the critical checkout path: search -> add to cart -> checkout -> payment -> confirmation (mock payment)."

### Functional scenarios (positive)

- "Write Selenium tests implementing positive user flows for {url}: signup, login, password reset, profile update, and logout. Use POM and data-driven input from {data_file}."
- "Create data-driven tests that read inputs from {data_file} and assert expected outputs for a complex form submission flow."

### Functional scenarios (negative & edge)

- "Generate negative tests for form validation: missing required fields, invalid email formats, overlong inputs, special characters, and repeat submissions; include expected error assertions."
- "Create boundary-value tests for numeric input fields (min, min+1, max-1, max) and explain expected assertions."

### Stateful / session tests

- "Create tests to validate session handling: expired session behavior, concurrent login attempts, cookie tampering, and remember-me functionality."
- "Write a test to simulate multiple user sessions in parallel using separate browser profiles."

### File upload / download / windows / frames

- "Write tests for file upload (single & multi-file) using temp files and server verification."
- "Write tests to verify file download; validate contents and checksum and clean up downloads after assertions."
- "Create tests for alerts, prompts, frames/iframes, and switching between multiple windows/tabs with examples."

### JS executor & difficult interactions

- "Provide examples of using JS executor to click elements, scroll into view, and read complex DOM attributes when WebDriver actions fail."
- "Create tests for drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, and hover interactions with fallbacks."

### Synchronization & stability

- "Create robust waiting strategies: explicit wait wrappers, polling utilities, and examples replacing Thread.sleep with ExpectedConditions."
- "Produce a guide and implementation for handling StaleElementReferenceException with retry logic and stable re-locators."

### Cross-browser & responsive testing

- "Generate cross-browser test config for {browser_list} including capabilities, headless options, and browser-specific quirks; include a local and CI example."
- "Create responsive tests validating UI elements at mobile/tablet/desktop viewports and emulate mobile gestures where applicable."

### Parallelization, Grid, Docker & Cloud

- "Create configuration for Selenium Grid (or Docker-Selenium) with examples to run tests in parallel across multiple nodes."
- "Generate a Docker Compose to run Selenium Grid and example tests against it locally."
- "Produce integration examples for cloud providers (BrowserStack/Sauce Labs) showing capabilities, secure keys, and sample test run."

### CI / pipeline integration

- "Provide a complete {ci_provider} workflow to run tests on PRs and nightly: install dependencies, run tests in parallel, collect reports, artifacts, and fail fast on critical tests."
- "Generate a pipeline job that runs only the smoke suite on merge to main and full regression nightly; include artifact retention rules."

### Reporting & observability

- "Integrate Allure/ExtentReports (or {reporter}) into the project; generate sample report configuration and test annotations for attachments and step logs."
- "Add structured logging and test step tracing; show example logs for a failing test including stacktrace and screenshot."

### Visual regression & accessibility

- "Create a visual regression test using a pixel-diff approach (or Applitools) for the homepage; include baseline capture and per-environment baselines."
- "Add accessibility checks using axe-core integrated into Selenium tests; output violations and fail for critical rules."

### API & DB integration for setup/teardown

- "Generate helpers to create test fixtures via API calls before running UI tests and to clean up data after tests."
- "Create a test that seeds the database with test data, executes the UI flow, and then verifies DB state; include a Testcontainers example for an isolated DB."

### Security / injection checks

- "Create Selenium tests that validate basic security checks: input escaping for XSS, CSP headers, secure cookie flags."
- "Generate tests that attempt common injection strings and assert the system sanitizes input or returns safe errors."

### Localization / i18n testing

- "Produce tests that switch locale and verify translations, date/time formats, and layout adjustments for {languages}."

### Performance & timing checks (basic)

- "Add measurement hooks to capture page load time and API response times during UI flows; produce thresholds and include them in reports."

### Data-driven & parameterized tests

- "Create data-driven test examples that read CSV/JSON/Excel and generate test cases dynamically; include validation and negative combinations."

### Flaky test detection & mitigation

- "Generate a utility that tracks flaky tests across CI runs and groups by failure signature; provide triage guidance."
- "Add mitigations (better waits, fewer sleeps, idempotent test data) with example refactors to reduce flakiness."

### Maintenance & refactor prompts

- "Refactor this test file to Page Object Model; reduce duplicated waits and centralize selectors into page classes." (attach current test)
- "Review test code and suggest improvements for stability, readability, and performance; return a short actionable diff."

### Selectors & resilient locators

- "Given a failing selector, suggest more resilient alternatives and provide a fallback strategy if the primary attribute changes."

### Full-scenario examples (end-to-end)

- "Generate end-to-end tests for a commerce site: search -> filter -> add-to-cart -> checkout -> payment gateway (mocked) -> order confirmation; include assertions, teardown, and logging."
- "Create an authentication test matrix: valid credentials, invalid credentials, locked account, expired password, multi-factor flow."

### Test data management & secrets

- "Create strategies and helper code to manage test data, mask PII, and fetch secrets securely in CI (vault/secret manager examples)."

### Code-quality, review & standards

- "Generate linter/formatter config and pre-commit hooks for the test project (e.g., black/flake8 for Python, spotless/checkstyle for Java)."
- "Produce a PR checklist focused on test quality, reproducibility, and flakiness risk."

### Migration & upgrade

- "Migrate Selenium 3 scripts to Selenium 4 idioms and updated browser capabilities; provide a conversion example."

### Quick one-line prompts (reusable)

- "Write a {lang} Selenium Page Object for the login page at {url} with methods: login(username,password), isLoggedIn(), getErrorMessage()."
- "Write a {framework} test that reads test cases from {data_file} and runs them in parallel with retries and screenshot on failure."
- "Produce a GitHub Actions workflow to run the smoke suite and publish Allure reports."

### Prompt composition checklist

- Specify language/framework, target URL or sample HTML, project layout preference (POM), desired reporter, CI provider, browsers and infra (Docker/Grid/Testcontainers). Attach small HTML or API samples when possible.
- Ask for runnable code when you want it executable; otherwise request pseudo-code or design notes.
- Request supporting files (pom.xml/requirements.txt/README/CI yaml) along with tests when you want a complete project.
